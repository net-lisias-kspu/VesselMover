## Description

Use the toolbar menu buttons to pick up or place a vessel. It must be landed or splashed down in order to pick it up.

Use pitch/yaw (WASD by default) to move around.

Use roll (Q/E by default) to roll, and translation buttons (IJKL by default) to rotate pitch and yaw.

Use translate fwd/back (H or N by default) to auto rotate planes and rockets respectively to level/upright.

Press Tab to toggle speed modes. For long distances, it works well to use "Ludicrous speed" in map mode!

Click spawn vessel to open the craft browser.  Select a craft, then select a place to spawn it. 

It will spawn in vessel-move mode so you can reposition it or rotate it before placing it down.
